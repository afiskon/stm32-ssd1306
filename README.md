[4ilo/ssd1306-stm32HAL](https://github.com/4ilo/ssd1306-stm32HAL) library
developed by Olivier Van den Eede ( [@4ilo](https://github.com/4ilo) ) in 2016.

There is a [DuyTrandeLion/nrf52-ssd1309](https://github.com/DuyTrandeLion/nrf52-ssd1309) port to nRF52 of this library made by [@DuyTrandeLion](https://github.com/DuyTrandeLion) in 2020.
