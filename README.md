# stm32-ssd1306

STM32 library for working with OLEDs based on SSD1306, SH1106 and SSD1309,
supports I2C and 4-wire SPI.

Tested on STM32F1 and STM32F4 MCUs, with 10 random displays from eBay. Also this
code is known to work with
[afiskon/fpga-ssd1306-to-vga](https://github.com/afiskon/fpga-ssd1306-to-vga).

Please see `examples` directory and `ssd1306/ssd1306.h` for more details.

The code is based on
[4ilo/ssd1306-stm32HAL](https://github.com/4ilo/ssd1306-stm32HAL) library
developed by Olivier Van den Eede ( [@4ilo](https://github.com/4ilo) ) in 2016.
